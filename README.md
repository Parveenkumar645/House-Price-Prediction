# House-Price-Prediction

This project predicts ** House prices** using machine learning.  
It uses the ** Housing Dataset** from `scikit-learn` and applies regression models (including **XGBoost**) to estimate median house values based on features like location, number of rooms, population, and income.

---

##  Project Overview
- Load and explore the ** Housing Dataset**.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Split the dataset into **train/test** sets.
- Train regression models:
  - Linear Regression (baseline)
  - XGBoost Regressor (advanced)
- Evaluate performance using metrics like **RÂ² Score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.
- Visualize predictions vs actual house prices.
